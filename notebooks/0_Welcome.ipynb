    " * Some familiarity with programming languagues (it doesn't have to be Python, we will be going through some basics here).\n",
    " * Some familiarity with convolutional neural networks (either from the past presentation or otherwise).\n",

    "### üêç [Part 1: Exploring Jupyter Notebooks & Python](./1_Exploring_Jupyter_Python.ipynb)\n",
    " * Learn about using Jupyter Notebooks and Python.\n",
    " * Essential if you are unfamiliar with either -- highly recommended even if you are to make sure we're both on the same page! üìñüìñüìñ\n",
    " \n",
    "### üèûÔ∏è [Part 2: Data Exploration](./2_Data_Exploration.ipynb)\n",
    " * Introducing the data science pipeline.\n",
    " * Basic exploration, data cleaning and wrangling to set us up for Part 3.\n",
    " \n",
    "### üí™ [Part 3: Building and Training Your Model](./3_Constructing_Network.ipynb)\n",
    " * Replicate a popular convolutional neural network structure (the LeNet).\n",
    " * Train on a small sample of the data (ie. a single mini-batch).\n",
    " \n",
    "### üöÄ [Part 4: To Infinity and Beyond!](./4_Scaling_Model.ipynb)\n",
    " * Scale up training to multiple passes of the entire training dataset (epochs).\n",
    " * Discuss the effects of overfitting.\n",
    " * Appendix for resources and further discussion."
